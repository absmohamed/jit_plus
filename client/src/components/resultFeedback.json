People with domain knowledge, or more motivated exploratory skills, tend to see opportunities where others don’t see opportunities or perceive more risk than they’re willing to take. Entrepreneurs have been known to be capable risk managers whose abilities defuse what others might perceive as excessive risk: entrepreneurs believe that risk can be reduced by increased effort, skill or execution. It is clear that people who are more entrepreneurial adopt greater risk on average - entrepreneurs risk their time (often unpaid, or for relatively less money) and their own capital in order to realise their goals. Your risk propensity is the degree to which you are open to taking chances with respect to affordable loss. Risk-taking is fundamental to entrepreneurship as entrepreneurial decisions are made in highly uncertain circumstances. As an entrepreneur you bear the ultimate responsibility for your decisions with risk of personal loss. Dealing with entry into new ventures or new markets, introducing new products or services, engaging uncertain consumer and competitive responses, dealing with resource and supplier availability, and most significantly, having your own investment of time and money on the line…all equate to higher levels of risk propensity.  Such levels of potential personal accountability/gain/loss are not borne by managers or employees.

You tend to take control and make things happen rather than simply adjusting to a situation or waiting for something to happen; you have an internal locus of control.

      "high": "Many entrepreneurs desire to achieve at a high level. The higher you score in your need to achieve the more likely you are internally driven by a strong desire to compete, to excel against self-imposed standards and to pursue and attain challenging goals. A need for achievement (N-Ach) refers to your desire for significant accomplishment, mastering of skills, control, or high standards. N-Ach often includes intense, prolonged, and repeated efforts to accomplish something difficult. To work with singleness of purpose towards a high and distant goal. To have the determination to win. This need is influenced by your internal drive for action (intrinsic motivation), and the pressure exerted by the expectations of others (extrinsic motivation). N-Ach motivates entrepreneurs to succeed in competition with other businesses, and to excel in activities important to them. You are more likely to seek challenges and a high degree of independence. Your most satisfying reward is more likely to be the recognition of your achievements. Take care though, not all high-need-for-achievement is considered positive…a constant, insatiable need to achieve can lead to anxiety and dysfunction, and that instead of happiness or well-being, high- N-Ach professionals seek \"relief in the accomplishment of tasks\" creating a cycle marked by a lack of a real sense of purpose.",
      "low": "If you score lower on need for achievement (N-Ach) it suggests that you might choose easy tasks in order to minimise risk of failure, or highly difficult tasks, such that failure might be reasonably expected and would not be embarrassing. Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks, feeling that they are challenging, but within reach. People high in N-Ach are characterised by a tendency to seek challenges and a high degree of independence. Their most satisfying reward is the recognition of their achievements…you can join them."

The more resilient you are the more your ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change.

Your resilience enables you to renew yourself over time through innovation and adjustments to diverse and turbulent changes in the environment. You tend to have a higher degree of self-esteem; feel you are in control and not afraid to fail; in the case of adversity you are more likely to ‘rise again’ stronger than before due to learning from a situation, having made and learned from mistakes, and seeing them as an opportunity rather than a failure.
